So Far in Sprint-2 we downloaded the Dataset and Images for each classification of heart-diseaes.

And now here we are Importing Libraries from pip

Due to there was too many images we cannot manually upload dataset so we created a new branch to access the dataset.
1.ImageGenerator
	-> pip install image-generator
2.TensorFlow Keras -(An implementation of the Keras API that uses TensorFlow as a backend)
	->pip install keras
These are Done in locally.
After this we've Registered For IBM Cloud.

All About Sprint-2.
